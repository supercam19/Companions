And more features, such as:
- A friendship system, where you increase your friendship with your companion by fighting together and spending time together
- Increasing your companion's friendship means your companion's stats will increase, such as its health and damage to the point of becoming a very effective teammate in combat. Higher friendship levels also mean being able to get better gifts, and better gifts become more common
- Companions will randomly find a gift to give you, to collect the gift approach your companion. Worse gifts, like diamonds, are more common, better gifts, like nether stars, are more rare.
- The gifts companions find their owners are based on the dimension they are in, for example, you might receive a shulker shell in the end dimension, netherite scraps in the nether or totems of undying in the overworld. Theses items are exclusive to one dimension, though some can be received in multiple dimensions.
